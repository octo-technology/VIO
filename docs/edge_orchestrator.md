# Edge Orchestrator

The supervisor orchestrates the following steps as soon as it is triggered:

1. image capture
2. image backup
3. metadata backup
4. model inference on images
5. saving results

## Set up your development environment

To facilitate the installation of the development environment, a [Makefile](https://github.com/octo-technology/VIO/blob/main/supervisor/Makefile)  automates tasks:

    $ make
    ‚ùì Use `make <target>'
    conda_env                       üêç Create a Python conda environment
    dependencies                    ‚è¨ Install development dependencies
    tests                           ‚úÖ Launch all the tests
    unit_tests                      ‚úÖ Launch the unit tests
    integration_tests               ‚úÖ Launch the integration tests
    functional_tests                ‚úÖ Launch the functional tests
    pyramid                         ‚®∫ Compute the tests pyramid
    pyramid_and_badges              üìõ Generate Gitlab badges

** Python interpreter installation **

The project uses `conda` to manage Python virtual environments [Miniconda installation guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

** Install conda on MacOS **

The most direct way to install `conda` is still Homebrew:

    brew update
    brew install --cask miniconda

** Initialize the project environment **

Once Miniconda is installed, create the Python virtual environment and install its dependencies using the Makefile:

    cd supervisor
    make conda_env

** Install project dependencies **

    make dependencies

** Setuptools "editable mode" **

To be able to benefit from Python packaging without being impacted during local development (i.e. without having to rebuild a package each time it is updated), we use the editable mode (see the official pip [doc](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable)).

    pip install -e .

During the installation of the development environment, the above command will have the following effect:

A file supervisor.egg-link was created in the supervisor virtual environment with the following content:

    cat /usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/supervisor/lib/python3.9/site-packages/supervisor.egg-link
    /path/to/project/sources/vio_edge/supervisor

Thus, thanks to the egg-link, the python module supervisor is properly installed as a library in the virtual environment, but does not require regular repackaging after an update in local.

** Setuptools "development mode" **

To be able to install the library and its development dependencies (test libraries):

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

** Setuptools "console_scripts" EntryPoints **

In the [supervisor.egg-link](/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/supervisor/lib/python3.9/site-packages/supervisor.egg-link) file of the supervisor, the following entry_points block is configured

```python
setup(
    name="supervisor",
    # [...]
   entry_points={
      'console_scripts': [
         'supervisor = supervisor.__main__:main',
      ],
   },
)
```

The `setuptools` package allows you to configure different types of scripts, including console_scripts, which will generate a "shim" shell script that will be placed on the PATH and will call the supervisor.__main__:main function as configured.

This supervisor [supervisor](/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/supervisor/bin/supervisor)  is located in the virtual environment created during project installation.

When the virtual environment is activated (by running `conda` activate supervisor), the $PATH environment variable is configured to point to the bin/ folder of the virtual environment.

```shell
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/supervisor/bin:[...]
```

If we look inside this script, we notice that it is responsible for importing our supervisor module and calling its entry point.

```shell
#!/usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/supervisor/bin/python3.9
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'supervisor','console_scripts','supervisor'
import re
import sys

# for compatibility with easy_install; see #2198
__requires__ = 'supervisor'

from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

[...]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(load_entry_point('supervisor', 'console_scripts', 'supervisor')())
```
For more information, the documentation can be found [here](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html).

## Tests

To run all tests:

    make tests

To run only unit tests:

    make unit_tests

## API Routes

All routes are prefixed with api/v1. For example, to retrieve the list of items locally, use this url: 
[http://localhost:8000/api/v1/items](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/items)

You can also refer to the API swagger on the /docs url: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Add a new configuration 

All the JSON config files are in `supervisor/config/station_configs`
If you want to create a new config, you need to add a new JSON in the above directory.
Here's a template of a config file.

```
{
  "cameras": {
    "camera_id3": {
      "type": "fake" #type of the camera : fake, pi_camera or usb_camera
      "input_images_folder": "people_dataset",
      "position": "front",
      "exposition": 100,
      "models_graph": {
        "model_id1": {
          "metadata": "mobilenet_ssd_v2_coco", #name of the model
          "depends_on": [], #if this model depends on another model, if none then empty list
          "class_to_detect": ["cell phone"] #class to detect, always in list format and only for object detection model. If classification model, can delete this row
        },
        "model_id6": {
          "metadata": "cellphone_connection_control",#name of the model
          "depends_on": [ 
            "model_id1"
          ], #the model_id6 depends on the model_id1
          "class_to_detect": ["connected"]
        }
      },
      "camera_rule": {
        "name": "min_nb_objects_rule", #name of the camera rule
        "parameters": {
          "class_to_detect": ["person"], #always a list
          "min_threshold": 1
        }
      }
    },
    "camera_id2": { # if there's another camera, if not you can delete this section, if there's a third then add one.
      "type": "fake",
      "input_images_folder": "people_dataset",
      "position": "front",
      "exposition": 100,
      "models_graph": {

        }
      },
      "camera_rule": {
        "name": "min_nb_objects_rule",
        "parameters": {
          "class_to_detect": ["face"],
          "min_threshold": 1
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "item_rule": {
    "name": "min_threshold_KO_rule", #the item rule name
    "parameters": {
      "threshold": 1
    }
  }
}
```

The comments are only here to guide you, you should delete them in your new json config.

## Add a new model

- All our models are in tflite format. In order to add an already trained model in the ```flite_serving ``` folder. 
Inside this folder should be the .tflite model and if needed a .txt file with the labels/class names.

- You also need to add this model in the inventory located in ````supervisor/config/inventory.json```` under the 
````models ```` category. 
  - Classification model
    ```
      "your_new_model_name": {
      "category": "classification",
      "version": 1,
      "pb_file_path": "modelforward/your_new_model_name",
      "class_names": [
        "class name 1",
        "class name 2",
         ...
      ],
      "image_resolution": [
        x resolution for your trained model (int),
        y resolution for your trained model (int)
      ]
    }
    ```
  - Object detection model
    ```
    "your_new_model_name": {
      "category": "object_detection",
      "version": 1,
      "pb_file_path": "modelforward/your_new_model_name",
      "class_names_path": "{name of file with the class names}.txt",
      "output": {
        "boxes_coordinates": "{name of the boxes_coordinates variable in your model}",
        "objectness_scores": "{name of the objectness_scores variable in your model}",
        "number_of_boxes": "{name of the number_of_boxes variable in your model}",
        "detection_classes": "{name of the detection_classes variable in your model}"
      },
      "image_resolution": [
        x resolution for your trained model (int),
        y resolution for your trained model (int)
      ],
      "objectness_threshold": minimum threshold score for an object to be detected (float)

    }
    ```


## Add new camera rule
In order to make a final decision i.e the item rule, we first need camera rules. Each camera gets a rule.
- Each rule is in a distinct file located in  ``` supervisor/supervisor/domain/model/business_rules/camera_business_rules ```
It's in this method that's the camera rule will be described. 
The method only takes the inference in argument.

- You also need to precise the camera rule in the station config in ```supervisor/config/station_configs/```

```
"camera_rule": {
        "name": "name of the rule",
        "parameters": {
          # parameters of the rules for example : 
          "expected_label": ["connected"]
        }
      }

```

- You need to add the new rule in the ```get_camera_rule``` function located in ``` supervisor/supervisor/domain/model/camera.py ```
which get the good method from the name of the camera rule in the station config file. 

## Add new item rule

This is to make a final decision i.e the item rule. Each station config gets an item rule (only one).
- Each rule is in a distinct file located in  ``` supervisor/supervisor/domain/model/business_rules/item_business_rules ```
It's in this method that's the item rule will be described. 
The method only takes the camera decisions in argument.

- You also need to precise the item rule in the station config in ```supervisor/config/station_configs/```

```
  "item_rule": {
    "name": "name of the item rule",
    "parameters": {
    # parameters of the rules for example : 
      "threshold": 1
    }
  }

```

- You need to add the new rule in the ```get_item_rule``` function located in ``` supervisor/supervisor/domain/model/item.py ```
which get the good method from the name of the item rule in the station config file. 

The camera and item rules are called in the supervisor method ```supervisor/supervisor/domain/use_cases/supervisor.py``` 
in the ``` apply_business_rules ``` function.
