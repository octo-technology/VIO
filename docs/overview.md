### Edge modules
- [The edge orchestrator](supervisor.md)
- [The edge interface](edge_interface.md)
- [The edge model serving](model_serving.md)
- [The edge deployment playbook](edge_deployment.md)

### Hub modules
- [The hub monitoring](monitoring.md)
- [The hub deployment playbook](hub_deployment.md)

All of those modules have been packages inside a dedicated docker images to facilitate their deployment.
